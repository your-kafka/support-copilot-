KYC Verification Process

KYC (Know Your Customer) verification is required to activate full account features, including withdrawals and high-value transactions.

Users must submit:
- Government-issued ID (Aadhaar, PAN, Passport, or Driving License)
- A clear selfie for identity verification
- Address proof (if required)

Common reasons for KYC rejection:
- Blurry or cropped documents
- Mismatch between name on ID and account
- Expired identification documents
- Low-quality images or glare

Users can resubmit KYC documents after correcting the issue. Verification typically takes 24–48 hours.

Repeated failed submissions may result in temporary account restrictions until manual review is completed.
