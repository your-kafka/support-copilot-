Unauthorized Transaction and Fraud Reporting

If a user reports an unauthorized or fraudulent transaction, immediate action is required.

Steps:
1. Advise the user to secure their account by changing their password and enabling two-factor authentication.
2. Temporarily block the payment method if necessary.
3. Record transaction details, time, and amount.
4. Escalate the case to the fraud investigation team.

Users should also be advised to:
- Contact their bank immediately
- File a complaint if required

Fraud investigations typically take 5–10 business days depending on the complexity of the case.
