Duplicate Charge Handling

A duplicate charge may occur due to network timeouts or repeated payment attempts.

If a user sees multiple charges for the same transaction:
1. Verify transaction IDs and timestamps.
2. Check if one transaction is marked as pending or failed.
3. Most duplicate charges are automatically reversed within 3–5 business days.

Users should be advised:
- Not to initiate a chargeback immediately
- To wait for the settlement cycle to complete

If both charges are settled and no refund is initiated within 5 business days, the case should be escalated to the payments investigation team.
